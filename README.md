# Adaptive AI Chatbot System

Welcome to my project! This repository contains the code for an **Adaptive AI Chatbot** system that uses AI to create an interactive user interface that adapts to user input. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how an AI-driven system can change its responses and behavior based on previous interactions, improving the overall user experience.

## Project Overview

In this project, I created a chatbot powered by GPT-2 that learns from the user’s input and provides context-aware responses. The system adapts in real-time to previous conversations, allowing for a personalized user interaction. It’s an example of how **Adaptive User Interfaces (AUI)** and **Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI)** can be implemented with AI tools.

## Features

* **Adaptive Responses**: The chatbot adjusts its responses based on the conversation history.
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Utilizes a pre-trained GPT-2 model from the `transformers` library for generating human-like text.
* **Interactive UI**: The chatbot engages in a dynamic conversation with the user, learning from each message.

## Requirements

To run this project, you’ll need the following Python libraries:
* `torch`
* `transformers`

These can be installed by running the following commands:

```bash
pip install torch
pip install transformers
